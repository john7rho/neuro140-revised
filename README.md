# neuro140-revised
Revised neuro 140 project to play in real chess environment

Used convolutional Q-network with Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm used to determine which moves to make

A messy codebase but the main files are in the endgame folder

You can run the notebooks, and they should train properly with ~100,000 to 1,000,000 iterations

Added a pdf of the writeup as well, includes links to demos
